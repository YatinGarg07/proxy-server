# HTTP and HTTPS Proxy Server with LRU Cache Implementation

## Overview
This project entails the development of a robust proxy server capable of handling HTTP and HTTPS protocols while implementing a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache mechanism for optimized content delivery. The proxy server enhances network security, performance, and efficiency by securely routing requests, handling encryption protocols, and caching frequently accessed resources.

## Features
- **HTTP and HTTPS Support**: The proxy server supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols, enabling secure and efficient communication between clients and servers.
- **LRU Cache Implementation**: Efficiently manages and stores frequently accessed resources using the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache mechanism, reducing response time and network congestion.
- **Encryption Support**: Implements encryption protocols to ensure secure communication over HTTPS, maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.


## Usage
1. Configure client applications or web browsers to use the proxy server.
2. Access HTTP or HTTPS resources through the configured proxy server.
3. Monitor server performance, cache utilization, and network traffic using provided logging and monitoring tools.

4. Watch it here...
